# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CC2 Mod Collection! To ensure high quality, we follow a strict process.

## The Process

1.  **Find an Issue**: check the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Jufie-bot/projects/9).
    - Pick an item from `To Do`.
    - Assign yourself to the issue.

2.  **Create a Branch**:
    - Format: `type/short-description`
    - Example: `feat/new-turret-sound` or `fix/lua-crash`

3.  **Develop**:
    - Follow the [Coding Standards](../wiki/Best-Practices).
    - Commit often with clear messages.

4.  **Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Open a PR against `main`.
    - Fill out the PR Template completely.
    - Wait for review.

## Rules
- **No Direct Pushes**: You cannot push directly to `main`.
- **Quality Gate**: Your PR must pass all checks (Linting, Docs).
- **Communication**: Be respectful and constructive.
