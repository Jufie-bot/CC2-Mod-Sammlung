<data name="Just A Few Hardpoints More" author="Darloth"
    description="Adds and changes a few vehicle hardpoints.  Not nearly as all consuming or widespread as Ribbons' specialized chassis mod, this just tweaks things and makes units a little more capable.  For now.

Walrus gains two external missile mounts capable of mounting any missile type.  You can technically put chainguns or rockets on these, but the hardpoint is tilted up so they may not aim nicely.
Albatross gains two missile hardpoints on wing pylons, exactly the same as its others, bringing the total to six.  This makes it a useful missile bus for loitering as well as a scout.
Petrel swaps the front gimbal mount for a light turret mount, capable of mounting any ground turret (including a ground observation camera).  Due to mod inefficiency controls are still reversed for this mount.  Petrel also gains three utility slots, all of which can fit Actuated Cameras if need be.  Again, controls for those will be reversed, not much we can do about that yet sorry.

(Game thinks it's incompatible with the UI Enhancer, but not really incompatible - you will have to merge scripts, see topic)">
